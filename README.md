## Varjo Designs

I'm a junior web developer from Finland, currently working at Sohova. I intend to combine development skills with visual intuition learnt from my graphic design hobby. 

### Frontend development

I'm currently more focused on doing front end work, mostly on WordPress sites. I'm currently focusing on React, and have some experience in jQuery and Angular. 

**React** - My favorite "proper" framework. I've used it in school projects and for standalone apps in WordPress front ends.   
**Angular** - Less experience, but have enjoyed it in the school projects it was used for.  
**jQuery** - Javascript multitool. Very handy in WordPress projects.  

### Backend development

I mostly edit and create plugins and themes for WordPress utilising PHP. I've done some Java in school, some Python for fun and some Node.JS w. 
Express for light projects. I've also used Java Spring Boot succesfully in two projects for school.  

**PHP** - My strongest backend language at the moment, as I use it daily working with WordPress.  
**Java** - I was taught to program with Java in school.  
**Python** - I took an extra course in school to learn Python. Enjoyable.  
**Node.js** - have found it perfect for light demo applications with Express.  


### Business applications

**PowerBI** - I've used PowerBI to conduct automatically updating reports and dashboards from different data sources.
**Sharepoint** - I used to admin a fairly large support site, which featured among other stuff embedded PowerBI charts, FAQ's, instructions and presentations.   


### Other frameworks and tools

**TailwindCSS** - I have been using tailwind on and off for about 9 months.  
**Bootstrap** - I have been using Bootstrap for about 3 years.  
**Backstop JS** - Backstop is great for visual regression testing. I've been using it for about 8 months.  
**WordPress** - The CMS most of the web seems to run on. Been developming some plugins, templates themes etc. various things on both backend and frontend based on it.  
**WooCommerce** - I've developed some utlities and views for WooCommerce projects.  
**Unity** - Who doesn't like playing with a game engine? Not very familiar with it, but have used it a few times to mess about with.  
**Blender** - I got a good sense of basics in Blender. Don't use it all that much but have fun every time I do.   

### Design 

**Figma** - I love Figma for designing simple UX charts, web designs and simple stuff like my CV.  
**Adobe Illustrator** - I love illustrator and have been using it for over 6 years by now. When all else fails, I'll go with illustrator.  
**Adobe Photoshop** - Defacto photo editing software, and my personal favorite one too. If i need to edit pixel graphics, it's my go to.  
**Adobe XD** - Done a few prototypes with it for fun. Works like Adobe software usually does, so able to use it if needed.  

## Notable projects here on Github
Please note that most of what I do is in private repositories. I do have some public display projects and test projects I've done for sake of experimenting, that I can show in greater detail. 

**My largest backend project:**  
StorefrontApp was created for our server programming course. It runs on Java SpringBoot setup, with a thymeleaf frontend and Bootstrap powered UI. 

**My largest frontend project:**  
Raspberry Consulting frontend was done using Angular for a school project. The task was to create a complete website utilising Angular, and extra points could be earned from extending the project. I created an website for an imaginary consultant firm, and integrated theme customized version of Google Maps.
